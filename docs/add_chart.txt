Display graph in rails:

1.Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
gem 'chartkick'
gem 'groupdate'

2.In application.js, add:
//= require Chart.bundle
//= require chartkick

3.In ...views\search_tests\index.html.haml (I think this works in any view), add:
= line_chart TrTrainingEmployee.joins(:tr_training_record).group("MONTH(tr_training_records.training_date)").sum("tr_training_records.hours_trained"), xtitle:'Month', ytitle:'Training Hours in Total'

Boundary issue:

This sql works:
SELECT SUM(tr_training_records.hours_trained),  month(tr_training_records.training_date)
FROM tr_training_employees
left join tr_training_records ON tr_training_employees.tr_training_record_id = tr_training_records.id
WHERE DATEDIFF(LAST_DAY(CURDATE()), tr_training_records.training_date) < 366
Group by MONTH(tr_training_records.training_date)
;
